# Phishing Detection Engine (Open-Source, Real-Time URL Scanner)

An **open-source, production-grade phishing detection engine** for fast, explainable, and auditable URL analysis.
Detect phishing and malicious URLs with **transparent scoring, clear verdicts, and detailed reports** — all in under a second.
Designed for **self-hosting, auditing and easy integration** into web apps, APIs, and browser extensions.

## Why Use This Tool?

Most phishing detection solutions are either **closed commercial APIs** or **academic ML demos**:

* **Commercial tools**: expensive, opaque, and impossible to audit
* **ML demos**: slow, fragile, and not built for real-world deployment

**Phishing remains a top cyber threat** because defenders lack **fast, explainable, and controllable detection systems**.
This engine fills that gap by providing:

* **Transparent, explainable analysis** — every verdict is backed by concrete signals
* **Fast, real-time scanning** — multiple analyzers run in parallel
* **Flexible integration** — web UI, HTTP API, browser extension
* **Full open-source control** — audit, modify, self-host, and scale

---

## What This Tool Does

* Scans URLs for **phishing, malicious behavior, and unsafe redirects**
* Produces a **trust score, clear verdict, and detailed report**
* Supports **developers and non-technical users** via UI, API, and extension
* Uses **multiple independent heuristic analyzers** for accurate detection
* Built with **Go (backend)** and **Svelte (frontend)** for production use

---

## Who This Is For

**Everyday users**

* Quickly check suspicious URLs in a website or browser extension

**Developers**

* Integrate phishing detection into applications or backend services
* Replace or supplement commercial phishing APIs

**Security engineers & SOC teams**

* Build explainable phishing detection pipelines
* Audit URLs with transparent, actionable signals

**Students & researchers**

* Use a real-world, production-grade reference for **academic or security projects**. Academic or research use of this project must cite this repository (see [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff)).





## Use Cases

- Detect phishing links before users click them
- Scan URLs for malicious behavior
- Build anti-phishing browser extensions
- Integrate phishing detection into backend services
- Replace or supplement commercial phishing APIs


## Detection Techniques Used

The engine evaluates URLs using multiple independent analyzers, including:

- Domain reputation & age checks
- Suspicious URL patterns and homoglyphs
- Redirect chain analysis
- HTTPS / certificate anomalies
- Known phishing indicators and heuristics
- Content-based signals (HTML, scripts, forms)

Each analyzer contributes to a final trust score and verdict.

## API Documentation

Interactive API docs (Swagger UI) are served by the backend at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
```

Full endpoint reference: [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)

## API Example

The phishing detection engine exposes a simple HTTP API for real-time URL analysis.
Scan a URL using the API:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/analyze?url=https://example.com
```

## Real-Time Performance

- Typical scan time: **~300–700 ms per URL**
- Designed to handle multiple concurrent scans efficiently
- Optimized for **real-time phishing detection at scale**

Exact performance depends on enabled analyzers and network conditions.


## Security & Privacy

- No URL data is sent to third-party services by default
- All analysis runs locally or in your own infrastructure
- Designed for auditability, privacy, and controlled environments

## Testing

Run the backend test suite:

```bash
cd server
go test ./...                          # all tests
go test -v ./internal/analyzer/        # scorer tests
go test -v ./internal/handler/         # handler smoke tests
go test -race ./...                    # with race detector
go test -coverprofile=c.out ./... && go tool cover -html=c.out  # coverage report
```

Coverage areas: `GenerateResult()` scorer (28 table-driven cases), HTTP handler validation smoke tests, URL utility checks, and rank loading.  
See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) for full details.

## Limitations
- Heuristic false positives
