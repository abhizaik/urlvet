## Development Setup

Run `make help` to see all available commands.

### Check prerequisites

```bash
make doctor
```

### Dev environment (Docker — recommended)

```bash
make dev-build   # build dev images
make dev-up      # start the dev stack
make dev-logs    # tail logs
make dev-down    # stop
```

### Local (no Docker)

```bash
make tidy                 # go mod tidy
make local-run-backend    # run backend via Air (hot-reload)
make local-run-frontend   # run Svelte dev server
```


## Code Style & Tools

```bash
make format          # go fmt (backend)
make format-frontend # prettier (frontend)
make lint            # go vet
make check-frontend  # svelte-check + TypeScript
make ci              # runs all of the above + tests (backend + frontend)
```

Commit message convention:

```
feat(auth): add token expiration check
fix(api): correct 404 response logic
```


## Running Tests

```bash
make test            # backend (Go)
make test-frontend   # frontend (Vitest)
make ci              # both + lint + format + type-check
```

Frontend tests live in `web/website/src/` as `*.test.ts` files.
Run `make test-frontend` with `--ui` via `npm run test:ui` in `web/website/` for an interactive browser UI.
